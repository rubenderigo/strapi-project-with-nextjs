# Next.js 16 + Strapi 5 — Full-Stack Practice Project

This project is a compact full-stack exercise using **Next.js 16** on the frontend and **Strapi 5** as a headless CMS.
The goal is to demonstrate how both sides connect: content modeling, APIs, authentication, server logic, and modern rendering patterns.

## What I Worked On (Full-Stack Focus)

### Frontend (Next.js 16)

* App Router and React Server Components
* New data-fetching patterns with caching and revalidation
* Server Actions, `useActionState`, and form handling
* Session validation, cookies, protected routes
* SEO with the new metadata system
* Deployment flow

### Backend (Strapi 5)

* Project setup and content modeling
* Components, groups, and dynamic zones
* Public/Private APIs with optimized queries
* Authentication: user creation, login, validations, and error handling
* Integrating the backend with the Next.js frontend

---

## What the Project Demonstrates

* A CMS-driven page structure
* Editable Hero section from Strapi
* Full auth flow: register → validate → login → protect routes
* Typed and optimized client/backend communication
